        <h2>Welcome Chasers & Hunters!</h2>
        <p>We'd like to welcome you to Scooter's site for chasing storms and hunting ghosts!
            Chasing things that most people run from is exciting and rewarding! It brings an
            adrenaline rush better than the strongest energy drinks and makes for an exciting 
            time! Whether it be virtually, at out camps, or on a live chase or hunt,
            we hope that you will find ways to join us on our chasing and hunting journeys!            
        </p>
        <span class="disclaimer">Please do not do any storm chasing or ghost hunting without 
            proper equipment and safety precautions!</span>
